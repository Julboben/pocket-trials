# Contributing to Hjulben

Notes for working on the game: setting up, testing, the code layout, conventions, the online backend and releasing. What the game is and how to play it are in the [README](README.md).

## Setup

Development needs Node.js 24 (the version CI uses) and npm. The game itself has no build step; npm packages are only used by the scripts and the Netlify functions. Run `npm ci`, then `npm run dev` to play and edit trails locally (see [Play](README.md#play)).

The game itself intentionally has no runtime dependencies. Only the Netlify functions use npm packages.

## Development notes

The game's most important asset is its handling, tuned over many iterations: throttle response, braking, rider lean, suspension, momentum, and camera feel. Treat changes to it with care (see the checklist at the end of this section).

`sw.js`'s file list, `js/version.js`, `js/changelog.js` (from `CHANGELOG.md`), `css/icons.css`, the app icons and `TRAIL_AUTHORING_CONTEXT.md` (the trail spec, schema, materials and example trails bundled for trail authors) are generated: run `npm run sw`, `npm run icons` and `npm run context` after changing their sources. `npm test` fails while any of them is out of date.

To test as a brand-new player on `localhost`, open the game or editor with `?sandbox`. All data then lives in that tab's `sessionStorage`: your real saves are never read or changed, online submits are skipped, and a SANDBOX badge shows at the bottom. The sandbox survives reloads, the editor, and playtests. Use `?sandbox=reset` to start fresh again and `?sandbox=off` to go back to your real data.

To check performance or investigate physics, open the game with `?debug=1`. Open the editor with it and its play test gets it too. Debug mode shows a frame-rate meter (frames per second, the average time each frame's work takes, and the slowest frame gap, refreshed twice a second) and a readout of the ride: speed, pitch, the controls and how much of the lean reaches the bike, the engine's revs and clutch, each wheel's surface, compression, load and spin, and how far the rider's head, shoulder and hip probes are from the ground. The overlay shows particles, constraints, contact normals, center of mass, and the crash probes, red when the head touches. `hjulbenGame.dumpRun()` copies the whole attempt (trail, seed and inputs) so it can be replayed outside the browser. `hjulbenPhysicsDebug.dump()` or `copy()` gives the last 120 steps in detail; the traces include wheel velocities, angular/contact state, torque components, suspension lengths, chassis area, constraints, traction, and collision responses.

`npm test` also runs the DOM-independent vehicle harness in `scripts/test-vehicle-physics.mjs`. It exercises flat acceleration, braking versus coasting, stationary wheel lift, air rotation, mirrored hills, valley settling, and one-wheel landing through the exact `js/vehicle-physics.js` code used by the game.

`scripts/test-replays.mjs` replays one recorded run per official trail through `js/ride.js` and checks that the finish time, apples, and crash outcome are unchanged, with no NaN values and no terrain tunnelling. After an intentional handling change, re-record the fixtures with `npm run replays`. It keeps every replay that still finishes and records the rest, several trails at once (`REPLAY_JOBS` sets how many, `REPLAY_MAX_MINUTES` the search time per trail, default 20). The search time is wall-clock time, so keep the machine awake while it runs (`caffeinate -i npm run replays` on macOS). The bot lives in `scripts/lib/replay-bot.mjs`:

- A greedy search drives easy trails.
- When that doesn't finish, an explorer takes over (`npm run replays -- --explore` skips straight to it). It strings together moves that human runs are made of: short held inputs, gas held for seconds while pumping the lean, coasting to a stop and turning around, and turning around in mid-air with a brake tap to flip. It favours places closest to the next apple through open space.
- A replay that used to finish but broke after a physics or trail change is repaired where it breaks rather than re-recorded from scratch. The recorder plays it until it crashes, searches a few seconds before that for a patch that takes the next apple, and carries on with the rest of the run. `--force` skips this and records from scratch.

For a trail the bot can't finish, add a human run. With the game running from `npm run dev`, finish the trail, or a play test of it in the editor, and press **Bot Reference** on the results screen. The dev server replays the run against every saved official trail and stores it as `tests/replays/human/<trail file>.json` for the one it finishes, replacing any earlier run. A play test of unsaved edits finishes none, so save the trail first. Without the dev server, copy your ghost from the browser console (`copy(localStorage.getItem(Object.keys(localStorage).find(k => k.startsWith('hjulben-ghost-v1:official:24-the-shaft'))))` for The Shaft) and save it there yourself. A human run that finishes becomes the replay as it is. One that stopped finishing is repaired like an old replay. To see which part of a trail the bot struggles with, `node scripts/probe-replay-bot.mjs 24` plays the human run up to each apple and gives the bot a few minutes to reach the next one from there. The simulation only uses `js/det-math.js` for transcendental functions, so a replay recorded in Node plays back bit-for-bit in the browser. Don't use `Math.sin`, `Math.atan2`, `Math.exp`, and similar functions in simulation code, because their last-digit results differ between JavaScript engines.

Run `npm run check` (syntax), `npm run typecheck` (JSDoc types in `// @ts-check` files), and `npm test` before pushing. After `npm ci`, `npm run test:online` tests the online API against an in-memory Postgres (PGlite) using a software passkey. It covers sign-up, unique names, login, cloud saves, and rejection of tampered runs. CI runs all of these.

`scripts/test-console.mjs` (part of `npm test`) opens the game and the editor in headless Chrome, served like static hosting, and fails on any failed request, uncaught exception, or console warning or error from the page or its service worker: in production the console should show nothing but the easter-egg hints. The pages load from a non-local hostname, so the service worker caches as it does in production, and the test checks that a return visit is served from that cache. It needs Chrome (`CHROME_PATH` if it is somewhere unusual) and is skipped without one; CI has it. The dev server marks what it serves with the header in `js/dev-server.js`, which is how the game and the editor know they may ask for the custom trail catalog and save trail files; a request that only the dev server can answer must be behind that mark, or this test fails.

When changing physics values, validate at least these cases:

1. Starting from rest on a moderate hill
2. Building enough speed to clear a crest
3. Countering an uphill wheelie by leaning forward
4. Braking hard on flat and downhill terrain
5. Landing on one wheel and then both wheels
6. Reversing direction and riding back through a trail
7. Crossing the gap in Skybound

## Stylesheets

The CSS is plain CSS served as written, with no preprocessor or build step. Each page loads three stylesheets in this order:

| Page          | Stylesheets                                           |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `index.html`  | `css/tokens.css`, `css/icons.css`, `css/game.css`     |
| `editor.html` | `css/tokens.css`, `css/icons.css`, `css/editor.css`   |

`tokens.css` holds the design tokens (see [Design tokens](#design-tokens)), `icons.css` is generated from the pixel icons, and the page stylesheet holds everything else. The service worker caches the stylesheets, so run `npm run sw` after changing one (`npm test` fails until you do).

### How `game.css` is organised

The file runs top to bottom in roughly the order the screen is built:

1. Base: box sizing, the global `[hidden]` rule, `html`/`body`, buttons, focus rings
2. Game shell: `.game` (including its loading, fullscreen and menu-open states), the viewport, HUD, scene labels, toasts
3. Dialogs and results: `.overlay`/`.menu-confirm`, pause screen, `.modal`, `.primary`/`.secondary` buttons, the results card
4. Settings controls: ranges, key bindings, setting groups and options
5. The handheld controls: `.control-area`, `.controls`, then each pad button and switch
6. Menu: screen and hero, saves and riders, menu actions, trails, leaderboard, Garage, How to Play, changelog, achievements
7. Cross-cutting rules: `.pixel-ui`, reduced motion, account login, and the dev sandbox badge

### Nesting conventions

`game.css` uses native CSS nesting, so each component keeps its states, pseudo-elements, children and responsive overrides in one block:

```css
.toast {
    opacity: 0;
    transition: opacity 0.2s;
    &.visible {
        opacity: 1;
    }
    @media (max-width: 760px) {
        overflow-wrap: anywhere;
        line-height: 1.35;
    }
}
```

Keep these rules when editing it:

- **Start every nested selector with `&`** (`& strong`, `&:hover`, `& > div`). Safari before 17.2 ignores nested selectors that start with a letter.
- **Put declarations before nested rules** in a block. Browsers released before late 2024 move declarations that follow a nested rule up above it, which changes their order.
- **Only nest selectors that extend the parent** (`.results-time strong`, `.toast.visible`). Don't nest a separate component like `.results-time` inside `.results`: that turns it into `.results .results-time` and raises its specificity.
- **Only nest under a selector list whose selectors have the same specificity**, such as `.overlay, .menu-confirm` or the pad button ids. A nested rule takes the highest specificity in its parent list.
- **Watch the order when moving a rule.** A later rule beats an earlier one of equal specificity, so a few responsive overrides stay outside their component, after the rules they must beat, with a comment saying so. Examples are the phone heights for `.menu-action` and its modifiers, and the phone grid for `.look-options`, which also has to override `.look-skins`.

Don't add `.foo[hidden] { display: none; }` rules. The global `[hidden] { display: none !important; }` near the top already hides any element with the `hidden` attribute, even when its component sets `display: flex` or `grid`.

`editor.css` is a separate, flat stylesheet and doesn't use nesting.

### Breakpoints

| Media query                                   | Used for                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `(max-width: 760px)`                          | Tablets and phones: stacked handheld controls, full-width shell   |
| `(max-width: 520px)`                          | Phones: edge-to-edge game, single-column menus, controls fill the space below the game |
| `(max-width: 370px)`                          | Narrow phones: the round pad buttons go back to the small shape   |
| `(max-width: 350px)`                          | Smallest phones: tighter modal padding and headings               |
| `(max-width: 520px) and (min-height: 600px)`  | Portrait phones: home buttons pinned to the bottom of the menu    |
| `(max-height: 500px)`                         | Short landscape phones: shorter menu rows                         |
| `(hover: none)`, `(hover: none) and (pointer: coarse)` | Touch screens: no selection ring or keyboard hints        |

### Handheld controls

The pad buttons are cut to pixel shapes with `clip-path` polygons on the 3px grid of their icons. `.controls` defines the small shapes as `--shape-round-small` and `--shape-flip-small`; its nested `@media (max-width: 760px)` swaps in the larger phone shapes, and `@media (max-width: 370px)` points back to the small ones. Each button's `::before` is its shadow and `::after` its face, both clipped to that shape.

## Design tokens

Shared interface colors, spacing, corner radii, typography, and pixel-shadow values are defined as CSS custom properties in `css/tokens.css`, shared by the game and the editor. Page stylesheets use `var()` references instead of new literals: `npm run tokens:check` (part of `npm test`) fails when a colour, font size or weight is written out although a token has that value, when a `var()` has no definition, or when a token is unused. One-off values with no token are fine; give them a token once they repeat. Trail-specific canvas colors live under `trails/official/` and `trails/custom/`, shared terrain materials and catalog loading live in `js/trails.js`, and simulation constants live in `js/config.js`.

UI icons are drawn as ASCII grids in `icons/pixel-icons.mjs` (`#` takes the text colour; other letters map to the icon's own palette). Run `npm run icons` to regenerate `css/icons.css`, then use one with `<span data-icon="clock"></span>`, or add one to a label with `data-icon-before`/`data-icon-after`. Set `--px` to scale it (keep it a whole number). The `logo` icon also generates the favicon and app icons (`icons/icon.svg`, `icons/icon-maskable.svg`, `icons/apple-touch-icon.png`).

## Online backend

How online riders and the world leaderboard work for players is in the [README](README.md#online-riders-and-the-world-leaderboard).

Server code lives in `netlify/functions/` (`account.mjs`, `leaderboard.mjs`) and `netlify/lib/`. It uses Neon Postgres and keeps no server-side sessions: logins and passkey challenges are HMAC-signed tokens. `_headers` sets the content security policy and the other security headers for every page.

Setup on Netlify:

- `DATABASE_URL`: the Neon connection string.
- `AUTH_SECRET`: a random secret of at least 32 characters, e.g. `openssl rand -base64 48`. Changing it signs everyone out, but they can log back in with their passkey.
- `RP_ID` (optional, default `julben.dk`): the domain passkeys belong to. They work on that domain and every subdomain, such as `h.julben.dk`. Changing it makes existing passkeys unusable.

Tables are created automatically on first use. A rider without a passkey (for example, one imported by hand from an older board) is unclaimed: the first person to create an online rider with that name takes it over, times included. Runs without a replay show on the board but can't be a ghost. Passkeys don't work on `*.netlify.app` deploy previews of the production domain (each preview host has its own), nor in `npm run dev`, which has no functions.

## Releasing

All work goes to `main` through pull requests. Only merging a release PR deploys: other merges to `main` don't change the version, so nothing happens. Netlify skips its own builds of `main` (see `netlify.toml`), and pull requests still get deploy previews.

1. **Actions → Prepare release → Run workflow**, choosing `patch`, `minor` or `major`. It bumps the version, writes player-facing notes for everything since the last `v*` tag into `CHANGELOG.md`, regenerates `js/version.js`, `js/changelog.js` and `sw.js`, runs every check, and opens (or updates) a **Release vX.Y.Z** pull request from `release/next`.
2. Read the notes in the PR and edit `CHANGELOG.md` on that branch if needed. If something fails, push a fix to the branch, or fix it on `main` and run Prepare release again (this rebuilds the branch from `main`).
3. Merge the PR. The **Release** workflow (`release.yml`) sees a version with no tag yet, runs the checks again, deploys that commit to Netlify (`deploy.yml`), and then publishes the GitHub Release `vX.Y.Z` (creating the tag). If the deploy fails, nothing is published: fix it and re-run the failed jobs. To redeploy or roll back, run **Actions → Deploy** with any release tag.
4. `git pull` to get the version bump locally.

The release PR is opened by GitHub Actions, so its CI run waits for a maintainer's approval. That's optional: Prepare release already ran every check.

The notes are written by Copilot CLI from the merged pull requests and commits. To pin the wording yourself, add lines to a PR description (or commit message); they are used as written and the PR's commits are not summarised:

```text
Changelog: Added a desert trail.
Changelog: fixed: The camera no longer jumps at the start.
Changelog: heads up: The leaderboard has been reset.
Changelog: none
```

`none` leaves the PR out of the notes. Preview the notes for the next release locally with `npm run release:notes` (uses your Copilot CLI login).

In the game, clicking the version number (`v0.1.2 · CHANGELOG`) under the logo opens **What's new**, which lists every release from `CHANGELOG.md`. After an update, returning players see a NEW badge next to it until they open it.

One-time setup:

- Repository secrets (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Secrets): `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` (Netlify → User settings → Applications → Personal access tokens) and `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` (a fine-grained personal access token with the **Copilot Requests** permission). Without the Copilot token, the release PR lists the raw commit subjects instead, for you to rewrite.
- Repository variable (same page → Variables): `NETLIFY_SITE_ID` (Netlify → Project configuration → General → Project ID).
- Settings → Actions → General → **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests**.
